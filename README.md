This repository includes code for the statistical analyses for the manuscript "Stress-enhanced opioid self-administration in healthy men: A randomized controlled experimental medicine study".

Click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbiele/SEOSA/main/Analysis_Paper1.html) to view the html with the analyses and some explanations of the analyses. By default all code is shown in the html. To view the html with hidden code, download the html and double-click the downloaded html file.

Some important code, e.g. functions for calculating contrasts of interest, are in the file 'utils.R'

Note that the code is not fully documented (yet).
The R markdown file that creates the html file as well as bata and mcmc draws of all models will also be made available upon publication.
