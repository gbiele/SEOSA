This repository includes code for the statistical analyses for the manuscript "Stress-enhanced opioid self-administration in healthy men: A randomized controlled experimental medicine study".

Click [here](https://www.google.com/) to view the html with the analyses and some explanations of the analyses. By default all code is hidden, but it can be toggled to be viewed.

Some important code, e.g. functions for calculatating contrasts of interest, are in the file 'utils.R'

Note that the code is not fully documented (yet).
